## Magnetic space-group type

### `uni_number`

The serial number from ``1`` to ``1651`` of UNI or BNS symbols.

### `msg_type`

Magnetic space groups (MSG) is classified by its family space group (FSG) and maximal space
subgroup (XSG). FSG is a non-magnetic space group obtained by ignoring time-reversal term in
MSG. XSG is a space group obtained by picking out non time-reversal operations in MSG.

- `msg_type=1` (type-I): MSG, XSG, FSG are all isomorphic.
- `msg_type=2` (type-II): XSG and FSG are isomorphic, and MSG is generated from XSG and
  pure time reversal operations
- `msg_type=3` (type-III): XSG is a proper subgroup of MSG with isomorphic translational
  subgroups.
- `msg_type=4` (type-IV): XSG is a proper subgroup of MSG with isomorphic point group.

### `hall_number`

For type-I, II, III, hall number of FSG; for type-IV, that of XSG

### `tensor_rank`

``0`` for collinear spins, ``1`` for non-collinear spins

## Magnetic symmetry operations

### `n_operations`

Number of magnetic symmetry operations.

### `rotations`

Rotation (matrix) parts of symmetry operations

### `translations`

Translation (vector) parts of symmetry operations

### `time_reversals`

Time reversal part of magnetic symmetry operations. ``1`` indicates time reversal operation,
and ``0`` indicates an ordinary operation.

## Symmetrically equivalent atoms

### `n_atoms` and `equivalent_atoms`

See [`equivalent_atoms`](@ref).

## Transformation to standardized setting

### `transformation_matrix` and `origin_shift`

See [Transformation matrix and origin shift](@ref).

## Standardized magnetic crystal structure after idealization

### `n_std_atoms`, `std_lattice`, `std_types`, `std_positions`, and `std_rotation_matrix`

See [Standardized crystal structure after idealization](@ref).

### `std_tensors`

Site tensors of the standardized crystal structure [idealization](@ref idealization).

## Intermediate data in symmetry search

### `primitive_lattice`

See [`primitive_lattice`](@ref primitive).
`primitive_lattice` generates pure translations without time reversals.
Thus, for type-IV magnetic space groups, a unit cell spanned by `primitive_lattice` contains
an anti-translation lattice point.
