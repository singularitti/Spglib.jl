## Cannot find the Julia executable

Make sure you have Julia installed in your environment. Please download the latest
[stable version](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release) for your platform.
If you are using a *nix system, the recommended way is to use
[Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). If you do not want to install Juliaup
or you are using other platforms that Julia supports, download the corresponding binaries.
Then, create a symbolic link to the Julia executable.
If the path is not in your [`$PATH` environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)),
export it to your `$PATH`.

Some clusters, like
[Comet](https://www.sdsc.edu/support/user_guides/comet.html),
or [Expanse](https://www.sdsc.edu/services/hpc/expanse/index.html),
already have Julia installed as a module, you may
just `module load julia` to use it. If not, either install by yourself or contact your
administrator.

See [Installation Guide](@ref) for more information.

## Julia starts slow

First, we recommend you download the latest version of Julia. Usually, the newest version
has the best performance.

If you need to use Julia for a simple, one-time task, you can start the Julia REPL with

```bash
julia --compile=min
```

to minimize compilation or

```bash
julia --optimize=0
```

to minimize optimizations, or just use both. Or you could make a system image
and run with

```bash
julia --sysimage custom-image.so
```

See [Fredrik Ekre's talk](https://youtu.be/IuwxE3m0_QQ?t=313) for details.

## Unable to install the package

First, verify if your platform is supported by referring to the
[`spglib_jll.jl` platforms](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/spglib_jll.jl/blob/main/README.md#platforms).
If it's not supported, kindly report the issue to the developers
[here](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/issues/new).

If you can install `spglib_jll.jl` but encounter issues with `Spglib.jl`, please report to
the developer [here](https://github.com/singularitti/Spglib.jl/issues/new).

## Returned cell symmetry is wrong

Check whether you set the lattice correctly. This is the part where errors can easily occur,
as we adopt a different convention from the Python and C versions.

For example, [the example](https://github.com/spglib/spglib/blob/v2.1.0-rc2/README.md)
shown in Spglib's official documentation is written as follows:

```c
#include <assert.h>
#include "spglib.h"

int main(void) {
    SpglibDataset *dataset;
    // Wurtzite structure (P6_3mc)
    double lattice[3][3] = {
        {3.111, -1.5555, 0}, {0, 2.6942050311733885, 0}, {0, 0, 4.988}};
    double position[4][3] = {
        {1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.0},
        {2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.5},
        {1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.6181},
        {2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.1181},
    };
    int types[4] = {1, 1, 2, 2};
    int num_atom = 4;
    double symprec = 1e-5;
    dataset = spg_get_dataset(lattice, position, types, num_atom, symprec);
    assert(dataset->spacegroup_number == 186);
    spg_free_dataset(dataset);
}
```

Thus,
[the Python correspondence](https://github.com/spglib/spglib/blob/ddcc153/example/python_api/example.py)
of the code should be:

```python
import spglib

lattice = [[3.111, 0, 0], [-1.5555, 2.6942050311733885, 0], [0, 0, 4.988]]
position = [
    [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.0],
    [2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.5],
    [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.6181],
    [2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.1181],
]
types = [1, 1, 2, 2]
symprec = 1e-5
cell = (lattice, positions, types)
dataset = spglib.get_symmetry_dataset(cell, symprec=symprec)
assert dataset['number'] == 186
```

Note that in Python, the `lattice` is transposed, as explained in its
[official documentation](https://spglib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/variable.html#lattice).

However, the corresponding code in Julia should be written as follows:

```@repl example
using Spglib
lattice = [[3.111, 0, 0], [-1.5555, 2.6942050311733885, 0], [0, 0, 4.988]];
positions = [
    [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.0],
    [2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.5],
    [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.6181],
    [2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.1181],
];
atoms = [1, 1, 2, 2];
cell = Cell(lattice, positions, atoms)
dataset = get_dataset(cell, 1e-5)
dataset.spacegroup_number
```

Although the Julia definition of our [Basis vectors](@ref) is not transposed
(like the C-API), when written one by one, it still resembles a transposed
version of the lattice in C. However, they both represent the following matrix:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
    3.111 & -1.5555 & 0 \\
    0 & 2.6942050311733885 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 4.988
\end{bmatrix}
```

Of course, you can construct the lattice directly using its matrix form:

```@repl example
lattice = [
    3.111  -1.5555  0.0
    0.0  2.6942050311733885  0.0
    0.0  0.0  4.988
];
```

If you are not careful when writing these matrices, you may encounter unexpected results:

```python
import spglib

lattice = [
    [3.111, -1.5555, 0],
    [0, 2.6942050311733885, 0],
    [0, 0, 4.988]
]
positions = [
    [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.0],
    [2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.5],
    [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.6181],
    [2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.1181]
]
types = [1, 1, 2, 2]
num_atom = 4
symprec = 1e-5
cell = (lattice, positions, types)
dataset = spglib.get_symmetry_dataset(cell, symprec=symprec)

>>> dataset['number']
4
>>> dataset['international']
'P2_1'
```

Or this:

```@repl example
lattice = [[3.111, -1.5555, 0], [0, 2.6942050311733885, 0], [0, 0, 4.988]];
cell = Cell(lattice, positions, atoms)
dataset = get_dataset(cell, 1e-5)
dataset.spacegroup_number
dataset.international_symbol
```

## Julia's results are different from Python's

For the same reason, the returned results from Python, especially lattices, are
transposed versions of those in Julia.

```python
>>> dataset['primitive_lattice']
array([[ 3.111     ,  0.        ,  0.        ],
       [-1.5555    ,  2.69420503,  0.        ],
       [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  4.988     ]])
>>> dataset['std_lattice']
array([[ 3.111     ,  0.        ,  0.        ],
       [-1.5555    ,  2.69420503,  0.        ],
       [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  4.988     ]])
>>> std_lattice_before_idealization = np.dot(
        np.transpose(lattice),
        np.linalg.inv(dataset['transformation_matrix'])
    ).T
array([[ 3.111     ,  0.        ,  0.        ],
       [-1.5555    ,  2.69420503,  0.        ],
       [ 0.        ,  0.        ,  4.988     ]])
```

These are equivalent to the following Julia matrices:

```@repl
[
    3.111   0.0      0.0
    -1.5555  2.69421  0.0
    0.0     0.0      4.988
];
[
    3.111   0.0      0.0
    -1.5555  2.69421  0.0
    0.0     0.0      4.988
];
[
    3.111   0.0      0.0
    -1.5555  2.69421  0.0
    0.0     0.0      4.988
];
```

However, the actual Julia results should be:

```@repl example
using Spglib
lattice = [[3.111, 0, 0], [-1.5555, 2.6942050311733885, 0], [0, 0, 4.988]];
positions = [
    [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.0],
    [2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.5],
    [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3, 0.6181],
    [2.0 / 3, 1.0 / 3, 0.1181],
];
atoms = [1, 1, 2, 2];
cell = Cell(lattice, positions, atoms)
dataset = get_dataset(cell, 1e-5)
dataset.primitive_lattice
dataset.std_lattice
std_lattice_before_idealization =
    convert(Matrix{Float64}, Lattice(cell)) * inv(dataset.transformation_matrix)
```
